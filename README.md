# Quantitative Portfolio Optimization & Factor Backtesting

This repo contains a summer project I attended at Huatai Securities, which covers:
1) Markowitz mean-variance optimization + Black-Litterman portfolio construction
2) A simple factor strategy based on PCA and its backtesting

## Structure
- `notebooks/` : analysis notebooks
- `src/` : reusable implementation (portfolio + backtest)
- `reports/`: figures and summary

## How to Run

### 1) Create environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Open notebooks

```bash
jupyter lab
# then open notebooks/*.ipynb
```
